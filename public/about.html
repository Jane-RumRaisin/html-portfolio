<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Welcome to my website! I'm Jane, an IT Project Manager with an unexpected but exciting journey into the world of technology.</p>

<p>My academic path led me to a Bachelor's degree in Economics, but my passion for coding opened up a whole new world for me. I decided to teach myself web development, and I've been on an inspiring learning journey ever since.</p>

<p>I started my IT career in Quality Assurance (QA) roles, where I learned the importance of precision and quality in software. This experience was a crucial stepping stone to my current role as an IT Project Manager.</p>

<p>These roles have given me a profound understanding of computer systems and the software development process. I'm here to share my experiences and insights, and to connect with others who are as passionate about technology as I am.</p>

<p>Let's explore the digital world together, learn from each other, and create amazing things. Thanks for visiting my website!</p>
